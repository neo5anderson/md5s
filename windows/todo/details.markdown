# 1. Tools

## Vim

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text  
editing. It is an improved version of the *vi* editor distributed with  
most UNIX systems. Vim is distributed free as chairtyware.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweigh markup language, allowing people "to wirte  
using an esay-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then covert  
it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)". The language takes many  
cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in email.  
In other words, Markdown is a **text-to-HTML conversion tool**.

## S5

**Simple Standards-based Slide Show System** is a slide show format based  
entirely on XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With one file, you can run a  
complete slide show and have a printer-friendly version as well.  
Anyone with even a smidgen of familiarity with HTML or XHTML can look  
at the markup and figure out how to adapt it to their particular needs.  
Anyone familiar with CSS can create their own slide show theme. It's  
totally simple, and it's totally standards-driven.

*Linus Torvalds* for Linux kernel development; it has since been adopted  
by many other project. Even Git working directory is a full-fledged  
repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilites,  
not dependent on network access or a central server. Git is free software  
distributed under the terms of GPL v2.

## Batch

Batch is the name given to a type of script file, a text file containing  
a series of commands to be executed by the command interpreter. The  
filename extension `.bat` was used in DOS, and the Windows 9x family of  
operating systems. The Microsoft Windows NT-family of operating systems  
and OS/2 added `.cmd`. Batch files for other environments may have  
different extensions, e.g. `.btm` in 4DOS and 4NT related shells.
